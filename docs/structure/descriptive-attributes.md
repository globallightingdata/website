## Introduction

GLDF covers a lot of native data fields to carry information that is not only relevant for lighting and light planning purposes. We also included elements that enable you to describe your product for use cases other than light planning. These fields include but are not limited to information for electrical planning, logistics, warehouses, or sales purposes.

Even if you need to transport information that does not fit into a native field within GLDF, we've got you covered. For that purpose, we invented custom attributes. Custom attributes allow you to put virtually any information you can come up with into the GLDF and use it in your application or use case.

You can use Descriptive Properties in the meta section of the product or on a variant basis. Properties set in the meta section will apply to all variants. 

We split descriptive attributes into the following categories.

| Category | Description |
|----|----|
| Mechanical  | Describes the physical appearance and weight of a product |
| Electrical  |  Electrical properties of the product  |
| Emergency   |  Emergency characteristics of a product.  |
|  Marketing  |  Properties you would typically used for marketing purposes.  |
|  Operations and Maintenance  |  Properties affecting the operation and maintenance of the product, such as useful lifetime, etc.  |
|  Custom Properties  |  Any property you can describe that is not covered above.  |
