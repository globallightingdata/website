## Description

`Geometries` is the ninth child-element of `GeneralDefinitions` - the part in the XML where **global and reusable** elements are defined (imagine them as the building blocks of each luminaire). The definition of Geometries is **optional**.

`Geometries` can be defined in two ways. First, simple geometry through a direct description in the GLDF, secondly, by a reference to an external L3D file [**File**](/docs/structure/files.md).
