In GLDF and L3D, units according to the **International System of Units**, or units derived from it, are used. The units are firmly assigned to the respective fields and documented accordingly in the XSD.


The following units are currently in use:



|**Value**|**Unit**|**Formula sign**|
| :--- | :------: | :------: |
| Dimensions | Millimetres | \[mm\] | 
| Angle | Degrees | \[°\] | 
| Luminance | Candela per square meter | \[cd/m²\] | 
| Power | Watt | \[W\] | 
| Voltage | Volt | \[V\] | 
| Colour temperature | Kelvin | \[K\] | 
| Luminous flux | lumen | \[lm\] | 
| Time | hours | \[h\] | 
| Mass | kilogram | \[kg\] | 
| Frequency | heart | \[hz\] | 
| Temperature | degrees Celsius | \[°C\] | 



> In GLDF and **L3D** dimensions are given exclusively in milimetres
