In GLDF and L3D, units are used according to the **International System of Units** (or derived from it). They are firmly assigned to the respective fields and documented accordingly in the XSD.

:::important
In both **GLDF** and **L3D**, dimensions are exclusively specified in millimeters.

## Units in XSD Reference

We did our best to provide all units also in the [XSD Reference](pathname:///xsd-reference/index_Root.html).  
Here exemplarily illustrated for the `PowerRange` element:
