## Introduction

Now that a GLDF XML file has been created as described in the previous chapters, the next step is to **package it** together with the **referenced files** in a common **ZIP archive**. We decided to do this so that GLDFs always consist of a **single file** - and are thus easier to exchange or download. It also reduces the risk of files being forgotten when they are passed on.

Another advantage is **compression**, so GLDFs consume less storage space and/or bandwidth.

In addition, we evaluate **signing of GLDF archives** for the future. So that once created, they become immutable. And a manufacturers can **guarantee** that they were created by them and not manipulated. This includes all enclosed marketing, technical and photometric data as well as all files. For this purpose, another signature file will be added to the archive, which can only be generated by the manufacturer.

Even it is possible to create GLDFs without any files. Or to reference them exclusively online - to create a valid GLDF file, it is **always necessary to package it** in a ZIP archive with the file extension .gldf

## How to create

Lets step throuh a **simple example** on how to **create a GLDF container**. A complete specification follows in the [next chapter](container-specification.md).

1. The best way to start is to create an **empty directory** and to copy the **GLDF XML and all corresponding files** into it:
  <!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line -->
  <img src="/img/docs/container/create-1.webp" alt="GLDF Container" width="500" /><br />
  
  In this example we have 5 files this way:
    - The GLDF XML file itself named *my new gldf.xml*
    - One referenced Eulumdat file named *symmetrical.ldt*
    - Three geometry files for the three level of detail (see [`Geometries`](/docs/structure/geometries.md)) named *low.l3d*, *medium.l3d* and *high.l3d*  
2. **Rename** your GLDF XML file to *product.xml*, as this is the **expected name** inside the container

3. **Move** all **files into subdirectories**
  :::info
  The name of each subdirectory must follow specific rules: its the **first part of the conentType of the files it contains**. For all possible content types see [`Files` documentation](/docs/structure/files.md#available-content-types).
  
  So for all JPG images with the content type `image/jpg` it would be **image**. For all PNG images with the content type `image/png` it would be **image** as well. For geometry files with the content type `geo/l3d` it would be **geo**. And for photometries with the contentType `ldc/ldt` it would be **ldc**. And so on.
  :::
  In our example, as we have geometries and a photometry file, the folder structure should now look like this
  <!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line -->
  <img src="/img/docs/container/create-3.webp" alt="GLDF Container" width="300" />

  With the subdirectories
    - geo ðŸ – *low.l3d* + *medium.l3d* + *high.l3d*
    - ldc ðŸ – *symmetrical.ldt*
4. **Compress** all the content with a tool like [7-Zip](https://7-zip.org). Or using the Windows File Explorer: Select all files/folders ðŸ – right click and choose *Send To* ðŸ – *compressed (zipped) folder*
  <!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line -->
  <img src="/img/docs/container/create-4.webp" alt="GLDF Container" width="390" />
5. Finally, **rename** the resulting file extension to **.gldf** (it may be necessary to activate the visibility of file extensions in your Windows File Explorer
  <!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line -->
  <img src="/img/docs/container/create-5.webp" alt="GLDF Container" width="390" />
6. The GLDF file created this way can now be **distributed and used**
