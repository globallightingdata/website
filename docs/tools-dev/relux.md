RELUX offers all Luminaire Manufacturer Members a tool set to create, edit and upload product data to [ReluxNet](https://relux.com/en/search/luminaires/DE/#).

RELUX provides a centralized product data disstribution via ReluxNet. So a product upload to ReluxNet allows the usage of the product to all ReluxDesktop users instantly.

This ReluxMemberTools are Windows based applications and will also support GLDF.
It will be possible to upload GLDF instead of the Relux Standard Database (MS Access mdb) to fill up ReluxNet.

On the first months ReluxNet and ReluxDesktop will use just slightliy more inforamtion out of GLDF compared to ROLF II or the Standard Database. The usage of the wide GLDF properties and options will be increased with time.
