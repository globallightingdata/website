## Introducing

GLDF Editor is a web application to create and modify GLDF files. It runs in browsers and handles files from the local hard drive. GLDF Editor can be used to view existing GLDF files as well as to change them. To create a new GLDF file a template from a set of different complexity levels can be selected on startup. The GLDFs can be enriched with assets like images, photometric files, PDF documents or 3D geometries in the open L3D format. The assets can be uploaded from the local file system or just linked with an URL. It is possible to view and edit almost all the native properties of GLDF. The GLDF Editor is just to be used with one file at once.

### GLDF Technical Benefits

One advantage is obvious: luminaire manufacture members of RELUX and DIAL only must create one format and one geometry. In addition, the format also offers these new technical features for everybody, even for non-members of the two software houses:

- several variants of a product with its own GTIN
- definition of lamps in absolute (LED) or relative (conventional) state
- embedding of pictures, geometries, documents etc. as a file or link
- multi languages on all text data by using a link: dynamic assets form a central server are possible
- geometry from Eulumdat, simple geometry or as a 3D model; multiple LOD
- light emission surfaces, rotating elements, suspension points and electrical connection can be defined
- luminaires with multiple light emitters and/or sensors
- emergency lighting LDCs or Emergency Ballast Lumen Factor
- constant light output CLO and international maintenance factors
- spectrum and dimming curves
- checksum for pure data validation or detection of manipulating
- optional use of all ~400 CEN/TS 17623 - ISO/TS 7127 - lighting BIM properties
- use of other BIM, IFC or even custom properties

### Lighting

GLDF comes with all the lighting specials, which are needed to calculate and qualify the luminaire and sensors. Multiple Light Emitting Objects (LEO), Light Emitting Surfaces (LES), Joints, Lamp sets, Dim curves, Multichannel, CLO, Spectral data, and many more lighting data are the core of the GLDF. This is the big difference to all other complex and modern data formats.

### Properties

Today there are 110 native properties in the GLDF to describe products. Additionally, the main product structure with geometry and variants in the xml hierarchy delivers more in-formation than just plain properties.
With custom properties in the GLDF it is possible to add all kind of different properties of the product or the variant into the GLDF. This is quite efficient if the property source is official and public (e.g., an ISO standard). But itâ€™s also possible to transport own properties just for internal usage like a PIM ID number. Custom properties could also be an application-specific property just for a certain tool or environment.

In 2023 the ISO/TS 7127 is published. This ISO document is a property source for around 400 properties for lighting systems. The base is the European CEN/TS 17623 from 2021. The ISO technical specification incorporates more international properties and more properties in general.
The GLDF custom properties can be used with values or with files.

### Variants

The structure of GLDF allows an easy and effective handling of variants. Geometry, LDCs, all properties could be changed for each variant freely. There is one hierarchy level of variants. So, just one list of variants and not a matrix.

### Asset Links

Instead of physical files in the GLDF container it is possible to refer links to all kind of assets. LDC files, pictures files, geometry files or PDF documents could be stated with a URL to the file source. This allows a slim GLDF file size, a flexible asset handling and a direct update of the product data. Please be sure to keep the URLs alive long and constantly.

GLDF allows the use of several pictures with several types and all kind of documents.

### Open Geometry

With GLDF we also created L3D. A new and open XML based data format too. Based on the open OBJ 3D mesh format luminaire geometry is free to be created by any tool. L3D adds in an XML all lighting specific data to the geometry. Mounting point and electrical connectors are included too.
GLDF support 3 LOD levels for geometry: low, mid, and high.

### Emergency lighting

In GLDF the type of emergency features could be transported with the luminous flux for an emergency case. Even complete LDCs for emergency could be used.

## View an GLDF

Existing GLDF could be uploaded and displayed in the GLDF Editor.
Select the Upload GLDF Section of the Start page. Then drag and drop a GLDF file in the box or use the file dialog with a click in the box.
This works also with more than one file.
Click Open and the GLDF is loading into the GDLF Editor.

## Create an GLDF

Creation of new GLDF files works with generic templates. Choose the closed template to your new product and click on it.
The GLDF Editor will be load with the template which then could be edited to the new product.

## User Interface

On the top right of the user interface are the basic GLDF file functions. On the right side is a yellow button for the download of the GLDF. Beside the download a Save button is located. Just after a Save the GLDF is updated and not instantly with a change. The home button brings the user back to the Start page of the GLDF Editor.

<img src="/img/docs/tools/gldf_editor_ui_top.webp" alt="GLDF Editor Pic" width="750" /><br/><br/>

On the top left of the user interface the controls of the variants are located. All variants of the GLDF are listed on the very left side from top to down. One variant is always active and displayed on the top of the main information field. A click at another variant of the list brings this up to the main field.

<img src="/img/docs/tools/gldf_editor_ui_variant.webp" alt="GLDF Editor Pic" width="750" /><br/><br/>

The blue Edit Variant button allows a editing of the major variant properties in a new pop up frame. Here the name, text, numbers, geometry, emitters / LEO could be set in different languages. The Edit frame has on top buttons to the 6 groups of Descriptive Attributes of the variant. The close of the Edit frame is at the top.

<img src="/img/docs/tools/gldf_editor_ui_edit_variant.webp" alt="GLDF Editor Pic" width="750" /><br/><br/>

The centre of the GLDF Editor is the main information frame. Here all the information of the current variant is shown. This are the pictures, main properties, the 3D view of the geometry, and all photometrics. A small yellow icon on the asset fields (pictures, geometry, photometrics) leads to an detailed view.

<img src="/img/docs/tools/gldf_editor_ui_info.webp" alt="GLDF Editor Pic" width="750" /><br/><br/>

In the lower left side, the general product level with file assets, general definitions, and the Product Metadata is placed. The Metadata is the level for all variants of the product. The Descriptive Attributes here are also related to the product meta level.

## File assets

GLDF can contain a lot of different file assets. This could be pictures, LCDs, geometry, PDFs, and others. All file assets could be local / uploaded file or URLs / linked files. All file assets need to be classified with an type and needs to get an fileID (started with an letter, e.g. G1 or LDC5).

<img src="/img/docs/tools/gldf_editor_files_upload.webp" alt="GLDF Editor Pic" width="750" /><br/><br/>

## Properties

Properties could be entered on variant level or product level. The most are existing on both levels. The product level is valid for all variants. But the same property on a variant superseded the one on product level for this specific property.
Variants and Product have some general properties, like name, number, text, and picture. Beside this a wide range of descriptive properties are optional usable on variant and product.

## Geometry LDC connection

One of the most important points of the GLDF creating is the connection of geometry and photometry. The L3D (r3d, m3d) geometry object contain Light Emitting Objects (LEO) which needs to be connected to an LDC (e.g., Eulumdat file).
This happens only on variant level. With Edit Variant at the top a edit frame is opened. Here down below the ModelGeometryReference is set with a Geometry (an ID from a former geometry file upload). Below this geometry ID link all Emitters / LEOs of the geometry needs to be allocated to LDC via a emitter ID (from a former LDC upload and the emitter setting in the general definitions).

<img src="/img/docs/tools/gldf_editor_geometry-ldc.webp" alt="GLDF Editor Pic" width="750" /><br/><br/>

At the Emitter section of the lower left "General Definitions" product settings it is needed to define Emitters with an LDC file (via a Photometry ID) and optional with Light Source(s) and Control Gear(s).
