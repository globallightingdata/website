### GLDF Checker

The [GLDF Checker](https://gldf-checker.relux.com/) is in a beta state now. An online free to use tool to check the filling level of an GLDF for everyone. The GLDF checker shows the amount of filled structure and properties in an easy and graphical way. A good option for quality checks on GLDF files. The specific applications and groups help to identify the potential usage.

Just drag and drop a GLDF file or use the file dialog to upload one GLDF file.

The cubes on the right side shows the amount of filled properties in 8 major groups. It is simply just the exisiting value of an property and not the quality of the value. A click on one cube opens a short table on the left side with a list of missing properties for this cube.

On the left side the GLDF Version is displayed. Also on the left side there are 5 application groups. These are showing the proper usage of the GLDF in this specific appliaction. The GLDF will be compared with an set of properties needed for this application. Also just with a exisiting vaule for the property. There is no quality check of the value. The list of required properties comes from ZVEI and is updated from time to time. With an click on one application a table with a list of missing properties for this appliaction apears.

A list of all properties with there ISO GUID and a description could be downloaded as an Excel file on the left side bottom.

The share button allows the forwarding of the GLDF checker link inculding the current results to yourself or to others. It is also possible to send a email with this results link to others.
