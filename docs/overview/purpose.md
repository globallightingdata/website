### GLDF

RELUX and DIAL present the new unified lighting data format for luminaires and sensors. It could be used directly in RELUX and DIALux. GLDF is open and free available for everyone to create or to interpret. Thanks to the joint forces the format is technically robust, modern, and universal. In the future it may replace other and older existing luminaire data formats, which is a huge benefit in creating of data for manufacturers and a benefit for designers and luminaire data users in a reduced handling and an open structure. GLDF includes more capabilities as ROLF and ULD format combined.

GLDF was created by RELUX und DIAL experts with decades of lighting experience for all modern BIM use cases. Everything a manufacturer could communicate about his product, can be enveloped in GLDF.

GLDF ensures the usage in lighting design and lighting specialized applications as well as in all BIM environments. The open-source license (MIT) allows a wide and simple usage by all luminaire data creators and users. With GLDF the lighting industry gets a digital twin for luminaires.
