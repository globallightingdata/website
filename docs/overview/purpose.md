RELUX and DIAL present the new unified lighting data format for **luminaires and sensors**. Not only seamlessly compatible with **RELUX and DIALux**, GLDF is **open and freely available** for everyone to create or interpret.

Thanks to the joint forces, the format is technically **robust and modern**. In the future, it may replace existing luminaire data formats, which is a huge benefit in creating **universal** data for manufacturers. It also offers benefits for designers and luminaire data users, such as reduced handling and an open structure. GLDF includes more capabilities than both ROLF and ULD formats combined.

GLDF was **created by DIAL and RELUX** experts with decades of lighting experience, catering to all **modern BIM use cases**. Within GLDF, manufacturers can encapsulate nearly everything they wish to **communicate about their products**, achieved through either direct specifications or by leveraging the versatility of generic properties.

GLDF guarantees seamless usability across **various domains**, including lighting design, specialized applications, and diverse BIM environments. Its **open-source license (MIT)** facilitates widespread and effortless adoption by all luminaire data creators and users. Embracing GLDF empowers the lighting industry with a cutting-edge **digital twin for luminaires**, revolutionizing the way lighting data is handled and utilized.
