To create the very first GLDF XML on your own, **a simple text editor is all you need**. Additionally an **application to create ZIP archives** is required to create the [GLDF container](/docs/container/about-container) afterwards.

However, if you want a little more comfort when writing GLDFs, we recommend an advanced text editor or an IDE right away. Two of the most useful functions when writing XML are

- XML Schema validation
- Code completion and IntelliSense

If you do not already use a preferred text editor, we suggest one of the following with the above features:

### Notepad++

[Notepadd++ for Windows](https://notepad-plus-plus.org) is a free and lightweight editor, but already offers XML schema validation:

Provided the GLDF XSD is referenced (1), Notepad++ marks the faulty parts directly (2):

### Visual Studio Code

One step further goes the [Visual Studio Code IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com), which is available for all common operating systems. In addition to XML schema validation (1) like in Notepad++, Visual Studio Code also offers full code completion and IntelliSense (2):
