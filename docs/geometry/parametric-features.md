### No modeling or 3D software is required

You do not need any 3D modeling skills or software. The Service will provide you with a fundamental 3D model based on your chosen model type and the dimensions you configured. The quality of the model will naturally be less detailed than a hand-modeled 3D model, but it will be much better than the basic representation with a cube or cylinder based on the LDT file.

### 23 Predefined Models

We have done a lot of research to find the market's most used and widely spread luminaire types. We chose 23 models that best represent the entire market and will cover as many use cases as possible. We are confident you will find a model that can represent your product.

### Parametric

By setting parameters for the model's dimensions, you can adjust the models' size, look and feel to best represent your actual products.

### Web Service

Leverage the power of a web service based on proven web standards and compatible with any application or operating system.

### Fully automatable

Because the web services rely on standard web protocols, you can efficiently utilize them from your existing systems and environments and set up automated processes without reinventing the wheel or learning new technologies.

### XML Based with XSD

You configure the tool by writing or generating human-readable and self-describing XML code, which is easy to understand.
To ensure your configuration is complete and correct, we provide you with an XSD for validation. Use your favorite XML tools to validate the XML against our schema.

### Integrate with PIM systems

Suppose your PIM system has information about product dimensions and types. In that case, you can utilize this information, create automated exports, and download the parametric 3D models into your system fully automatically, without the need for human interaction.
