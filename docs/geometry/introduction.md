## Purpose


There are many reasons for creating a three-dimensional model of a luminaire.

They range from simple placeholder objects that help to avoid geometric overlaps to the most detailed product visualisations of design-oriented luminaires. 

From the point of view of most relevant planning processes, it is advantageous to create a model that allows the user to visually recognise the product without overloading the overall project with too many details (high-resolution meshes).
