**L**uminaire **3D** (XML Format)

The L3D geometry format allows luminaires to be defined by Wavefront .OBJ files. The L3D is a ZIP-compressed archive that contains at least the OBJ files and a **`structure.xml`** file. The XML file can be used to define the OBJ models position, rotation and other attributes to form a complex model with the necessary light emission surfaces. Optionally, different components of a luminaire with degrees of freedom can be defined, e.g. to represent gimbal systems or luminaires with movable objects.
