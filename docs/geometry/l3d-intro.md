## Purpose

**L**uminaire **3D** (XML Format)

The L3D geometry format allows luminaires to be defined by **Wavefront .OBJ files**. The L3D is a **ZIP-compressed archive** that contains at least the OBJ files and a **`structure.xml`** file. The XML file can be used to define the OBJ models **position, rotation and other attributes** to form a complex model with the necessary **light emission surfaces**. Optionally, different components of a luminaire with **degrees of freedom** can be defined, e.g. to represent gimbal systems or luminaires with **movable objects**.

The easiest way to create L3D files is by using the **L3D Editor**, which is described in the [tooling chapter](/docs/tools-dev/l3d-editor.md). The current version and published releases on the other hand can always be found in the [Download](/download) section or on [Github](https://github.com/globallightingdata/l3d).
