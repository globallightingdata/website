Today, RELUX and DIAL serve as the owners and maintainers of GLDF. We take our responsibility seriously in ensuring that the format remains up to date and is optimally practical for users. Our software houses will interpret GLDF and gather all contributions, issues, and suggestions. Over the coming years, we will work collaboratively to elevate GLDF to become the industry standard within the lighting industry.

If you possess a keen interest in joining the GLDF owner group, it is indeed a possibility. However, be prepared to invest your time and expertise consistently. DIAL and RELUX will carefully review applications and make a joint decision based on merit. Should you find yourself intrigued by this opportunity, please don't hesitate to get in touch with either RELUX or DIAL.

In addition, if you are interested in becoming a DIALux and/or Relux partner, we are also available to discuss that at any time and looking forward to hear from you.
