Since the whole [GLDF](https://github.com/globallightingdata/gldf) and [L3D](https://github.com/globallightingdata/l3d) format is **open source**. As well as our development tools like [GLDF.NET](https://github.com/globallightingdata/gldf.net) and [L3D.NET](https://github.com/globallightingdata/l3d.net) and even this website [(source)](https://github.com/globallightingdata/website), any **contributions are welcome**.

Contributing to any project requires coordination between people and processes. Like many others, we're using **Github** to collaborate. So before contributing, you need to [**Signup**](https://github.com/join) for a free GitHub account. Which is the service where most of our source files are hosted.

And be familiar with the languages behind the projects

- [XML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XML/XML_introduction) and [XSD](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/schema_intro.asp), which are the languages GLDF and L3D are defined in.
- [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), which is used to write this docs.
- [.NET and C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com), which is used to write the libraries.

Follow the steps in the [**Contributing to projects**](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) guide and read through the [**Git and Github learning ressources**](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/git-and-github-learning-resources) as required.  
Should you have **any questions or suggestions** regarding GLDF/L3D: [**Create an issue**](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) in the respective project on Github.
