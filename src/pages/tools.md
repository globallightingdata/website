# L3d Editor

L3D is the new **3D geometry file format for GLDF**. It is comparable to the old r3d and m3d formats, but modern and open for everyone. DIAL did the first step and provide the first **Editor for L3D**. With this tool it is much easier to **view, edit and create L3D** as just with standard text editors. It is a web application running in browsers and **free to use**. We hope that a larger community will start to investigate the possibilities of GLDF and L3D.

With the L3D Editor it is possible to **create a full L3D file from custom geometries**, to set light emitter objects (LEO), joints, electrical connectors, sensors, pendulum connectors and light emitting surfaces (LES) and more. The geometries have to be imported from **OBJ files** - which is an open and very common 3D data format that can be exported from most 3D modelling applications. The tool can open, manipulate and save existing L3D files from/to the local hard drive as well.
