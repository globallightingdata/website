# Tools

With the new Tools “GLDF-Editor” and “L3D-Editor” it is much easier to view, edit and create L3D and GLDF files than with just standard text editors. The tools are free to use for everyone.

## GLDF Tooling

GLDF is open souce, published under MIT licence. So everybody can use GLDF and create applications to generate or interpret GLDF. Even as commercial applications. RELUX and DIAL do the first step and provide the first tooling for L3D and GLDF. With this tools it is much easier to view, edit and create L3D and GLDF files as just with standard text editors. The tools are free to use. With this tools we hope that a larger community will start to investigate the possibilities of GLDF. Also professional data format experts could use this tools to get a better access to the new lighting formats.

## GLDF Editor -beta-

GLDF Editor is a web application to create and modify GLDF files. It runs in browsers and handles files from the local hard drive. GLDF Editor can be used to view existing GLDF files as well as to change them. To create a new GLDF file a template from a set of different complexity levels can be selected on startup. The GLDFs can be enriched with assets like images, photometric files, PDF documents or 3D geometries in the open L3D format. The assets can be uploaded from the local file system or just linked with an URL. It is possible to view and edit almost all the native properties of GLDF. The GLDF Editor is just to be used with one file at once.

## L3D Editor -beta-

L3D is the new 3D geometry file format for GLDF. It is comparable to the old r3d and m3d formats, but modern and open for everyone. With the L3D Editor it is possible to create a full L3D file with a custom geometry. With the tool it is possible to set light emitter objects (LEO), joints, electrical connectors, sensors, pendulum connectors and light emitting surfaces (LES). The geometry has to be imported from OBJ files. OBJ is an open and very common 3D data format. You can export OBJ from many 3D modelling applications. The L3D Editor is a web application running in browsers. The tool can open existing L3D files from the hard drive and allows to change them. L3D Editor stores the resulting L3D files on the local hard drive.

## Feedback

Both tools are new and in a beta state. We are happy to get your feedback, failure reports and wishes. Please send everything related the GLDF Editor to support@relux.com and everything related to the L3D Editor to support@dialux.com.
