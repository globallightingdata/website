The collection and utilisation of our users&#x27; personal data normally occurs after users have given their consent. An exception applies to cases in which prior consent can not be obtained for practical reasons and where the processing of the data is legally permitted.</p><p>(2) If we have obtained consent for the processing of personal data from the data subject, art. 6, para. 1, point a of the GDPR acts as the legal basis. When the processing of personal data is required in order to fulfil a contract, to which the data subject is party, art. 6, para. 1, point b of the GDPR acts as the legal basis. This also applies to processing that is required in order to perform pre-contractual measures. If the processing of personal data is required in order to fulfil a legal obligation to which our company is subject, art. 6, para. 1, point c of the GDPR acts as the legal basis. In the event that vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person make processing personal data necessary, art. 6, para. 1, point d of the GDPR acts as the legal basis. If processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party and the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not override the former interests, art. 6, para. 1, point f of the GDPR acts as the legal basis for processing.</p><p>(3) The personal data of the data subject are deleted or locked once the purpose of their storage no longer applies. Furthermore, data can be stored if provision has been made by the European or national legislator in ordinances, acts or other regulations in EU law to which the controller is subject. The data are also locked or deleted if a storage period prescribed by the stated standards expires, unless it is necessary to continue to store the data in order to conclude or fulfil a contract.</p><p>(4) Furthermore, we may also disclose your personal data to third parties when we offer participation in campaigns, contests, contract conclusions, or similar services together with partners. You will receive further information on this when you provide your personal data or at the bottom of the description of the service being offered. If our service providers or partners are based in a country outside the European Economic Area (EEA), we will inform you of the consequences of this in the description of the service being offered.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="your-rights">Your rights<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#your-rights" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><p>(1) You have the following rights in relation to us regarding your personal data:</p><p>a) Right of access
You have the right to request confirmation as to whether relevant data will be processed, and to information on this data as well as further details and copies of the data in accordance with art. 15 of the GDPR.</p><p>b) Right to rectification
In accordance with art. 16 of the GDPR, you have the right to request the completion of the data or the rectification of the incorrect data concerning you.</p><p>c) Right to erasure or right to restriction of processing

Once communicated to us, such a revocation affects the admissibility of the processing of your personal data.</p><p>(2) If we base the processing of your personal data on the balancing of interests, you may object to the processing. This is the case if processing in particular is not necessary for the fulfilment of a contract with you, which we will note in the subsequent description of each function. When such objection is raised, we ask that you explain the reasons why we should not process your personal data in the manner we have done. If your objection is justified, we will examine the situation and either cease or adjust the data processing or explain to you our compelling and legitimate reasons as to why we will continue to perform the processing as such.</p><p>(3) Of course, you may object at any time to the processing of your personal data for advertising and data analysis purposes.

Unless expressly stated in this data protection policy, the data stored by us will be deleted as soon as it is no longer required for its intended purpose and the deletion does not conflict with any legal storage obligations. If the data are not deleted because they are necessary for other legally permissible purposes, their processing is restricted. This means that the data is locked and not processed for any other purposes. This applies, for example, to data that must be kept for commercial or tax reasons. According to legal requirements in Germany, the records shall be kept in particular for 6 years in accordance with section 257, para. 1 of the German Commercial Code (HGB) (trading books, inventories, opening balance sheets, annual financial statements, commercial letters, accounting documents, etc.) and for 10 years in accordance with section 147, para. 1 of the German Tax Code (AO) (books, records, progress reports, accounting documents, commercial and business letters, for documents relevant to taxation, etc.).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="transfer-of-data-to-third-countries">Transfer of data to third countries<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#transfer-of-data-to-third-countries" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><p>If we process data in a third country (i.e. outside the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA)) or if this is done in order to utilise third-party services, disclose or transfer data to third parties, then this will only happen in order to fulfil our (pre-)contractual obligations, on the basis of your consent, due to a legal obligation or on the basis of our legitimate interests. Subject to legal or contractual permissions, we process or have the data processed in a third country only if the special requirements of art. 44 ff. of the GDPR apply. This means, for example, that processing is carried out on the basis of special guarantees, such as the officially recognised establishment of a data protection level in compliance with the EU or compliance with officially recognised special contractual obligations (&quot;standard contractual clauses&quot;).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="data-collection-on-our-website">Data collection on our website<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#data-collection-on-our-website" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><p>(1) If you are using the website solely for informational purposes, i.e. if you have not registered or otherwise conveyed information to us, we will only collect personal data transmitted by your browser to our server.

Their purpose is to make an Internet service more user-friendly and efficient overall. Cookies allow us to recognise the users of our website. Cookies can optimise the information and service on our website for the benefit of the user. The purpose of this recognition feature is to make it easier for users to explore our website. For example, the user of a website that uses cookies must not re-enter their login details each time they visit the website as this is done automatically by the website and the cookie stored on the user&#x27;s computer system.

In such a cookie, the contents of a shopping cart in an online shop or a login status are stored, for example. &quot;Permanent&quot; or &quot;persistent&quot; cookies refer to those that remain stored even after the browser has been closed. In doing so, the login status can be stored, for example, if users visit the website after several days.</p><p>(3) It is possible at any time to prevent the website&#x27;s storage of cookies by adjusting the relevant settings of your Internet browser and thus permanently deactivating the storage of cookies.
