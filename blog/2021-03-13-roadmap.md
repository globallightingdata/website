GLDF is a true teamwork of DIAL and RELUX. The further software development of libraries,
tools and the integration in the applications will need many efforts. Here is a preliminary
road map with time estimations of the next GLDF development steps.

**A**: The technical GLDF publication will appear on a on online repository. The GLDF and
L3D XSDs and samples will be provided. We invite manufactures to investigate the
format and send us comments and new samples.  
**B**: We will provide shared libraries for a .net environment to support a unified imple-
mentation.  
**C**: It will take some time before we are ready to provide some tools for creation.  
**D**: Finally, ReluxDesktop and DIALux Evo will import GLDF and work with it.
